Any non-breaking attack that strikes the Yo-Yo is nullified instantly, and the Yo-Yo is neither slowed nor stopped by them. Thus, head-to-head combat against Yorts is suicide unless the opponent is able to produce a Break attack of 40 or more damage to destroy the Yo-yo. Yorts cannot regenerate a destroyed Yo-Yo, and are completely helpless without it. If a Yort is deprived of its weapon, it will Escape after 2 turns. Yorts cannot damage other Yorts. If two Yo-yos collide in mid-air, they mutually annihilate each other. Yorts can't move while attacking. Yort attacks are faster than the battlechip version of Yo-Yo and have greater range, but have a tiny delay before the attack in exchange. Yo-Yos are immune to every effect (including Glitch) except Break. AoE effects can reach past a Yo-Yo, but do nothing to stop it. Yo-Yos self destruct if the Yort that fired them is deleted.",

If the enemy does run into the beam, they fire their Sensor Beam attack at the speed of light, which is practically guaranteed to hit. Firing a Sensor Beam requires an action only in that the KillerEye will pause to recharge after the attack, but there is no delay between tripping the laser beam and firing a sensor beam. If a Sensor Beam is fired after a KillerEye has already expended all actions for the turn, they skip the first action of the following turn to recharge. They cannot emit a new laser trip beam while recharging, and they cannot fire sensor beams consecutively as something must trigger the attack by breaking the line of a laser trip beam first. KillerEye viruses cannot maintain their laser trip beams while moving their eyes to look in a new direction, they also cannot perform a beam sweep with a sensor beam. Emitting or turning of a laser trip beam does not require an action, but taking aim at a new direction does.

They poke their heads up just far enough from time to time to see where the enemy is, but they are still protected from most forms of attack. Drop attacks, Bomb attacks (which fall out of the air after being thrown), and Ground attacks damage them in this state. Other attacks executed from a high angle/altitude also work. All movements performed by a Momogra are considered a dodge, as they occur underground, and out of sight. Momogras only attack in response to having an attack launched in their direction, and only if they have an action remaining for that turn. Momogras attack by instantly tunneling to the panel behind the enemy, popping out of the ground, and striking with a shovel. A Momogra is completely vulnerable to any form of attack during its own atack, and until it moves again following that attack. The movement prior to the attack does not require an action, but movement afterwards does. The attack cannot execute if the panel behind the target is a liquid terrain type, Metal, Broken, or Missing. The attack also will not execute if there is something currently occupying the panel they would be attacking from. If the attack cannot execute, the Momogra will not move. In the case of Glass and Cracked terrain, the Momogras will still attempt to attack, but suffer the consequences of doing do as those panels will break and damage the Momogra, also causing the attack to fail. Momogra get 1 free movement per turn at the start of the turn before their first action.",

Vineys are rooted in place, and cannot be moved. The main body of a Viney is immune to any and all forms of attack except fire element damage, but the vines the viruses uses to attack with are vulnerable to all attacks. The virus attacks by using a group of thorny vines to creep up out of a nearby panel, then move towards the victim in hopes of capturing them. Once the vines make contact, they wrap around the victim, and hold them in place while causing damage. The vines can only be escaped from by the target if the target dedicates an action with decent roleplay attempting to escape. The vines may also be cut or burned in order to allow the target to escape, but in the case of fire, the target sustains double the fire damage of the attack used to burn the vines. Summoning the group of vines requires an action, moving the vines requires an action, and damage is dealt to a captured target for each action the Viney spends trying to hold the target in place. Both the vines and the virus itself are damage zones. Any damage either one sustains counts against the virus' HP. Both are subject to terrain effects and those effects stack as if the virus were in two places at the same time (because it basically is).",

		"family_note": "Null&Void viruses are extremely dangerous top tier viruses. No player should encounter one until at least battle 6. Null&Void viruses move and dodge at an average rate by walking normally, but they also teleport before and after executing their melee attack. They regenerate half of their HP every action and their vortexes have the ability to instantly destroy objects and EJO or delete victims instantly with Gravity Crush. Their strategy revolves entirely around forcing an enemy into a vortex, and their attack choices will always be something that furthers that goal if possible. If not, they will settle for using objects and the terrain to damage or hinder the enemy. They are intelligent enough to use their abilities to cause a great deal more havoc than the average virus.",

Dominerds have StoneBody, but must drop their defenses to attack an enemy. Dominerds will only start attacking when they are alone, or the only other viruses on the field are also Dominerds. All Dominerds carry and use stage changing chips. Dominerds do not intentionally use their Teleport abilities evasively, and tend to rely on Invisibility instead. Thus a strategy of attacking a Dominerd by forcing it to defend or countering when it attacks will negate any evasion bonus it may have gained from teleportation, as well as invis.

The virus is able to defend against attacks from up to two directions at a time by positioning the 3 parts of its body in various formations. Any Non-AoE or Non-Phasing attack that hits a body segment is completely stopped, and has no effect whatsoever. Attacks with area effect can still hit the head even if they strike the body first, and phasing attacks pass right through the body as if it were made of objects.

When executed, the pot tilts or falls over, and the dragon charges at the enemy before looping back and returning to the pot. When threatened, they will duck into the pot, which is both indestructible and capable of shielding them from all damage and effects except those that manage to fly into the mouth of the pot.
