Any non-breaking attack that strikes the Yo-Yo is nullified instantly, and the Yo-Yo is neither slowed nor stopped by them. Thus, head-to-head combat against Yorts is suicide unless the opponent is able to produce a Break attack of 40 or more damage to destroy the Yo-yo. Yorts cannot regenerate a destroyed Yo-Yo, and are completely helpless without it. If a Yort is deprived of its weapon, it will Escape after 2 turns. Yorts cannot damage other Yorts. If two Yo-yos collide in mid-air, they mutually annihilate each other. Yorts can't move while attacking. Yort attacks are faster than the battlechip version of Yo-Yo and have greater range, but have a tiny delay before the attack in exchange. Yo-Yos are immune to every effect (including Glitch) except Break. AoE effects can reach past a Yo-Yo, but do nothing to stop it. Yo-Yos self destruct if the Yort that fired them is deleted.",

Vineys are rooted in place, and cannot be moved. The main body of a Viney is immune to any and all forms of attack except fire element damage, but the vines the viruses uses to attack with are vulnerable to all attacks. The virus attacks by using a group of thorny vines to creep up out of a nearby panel, then move towards the victim in hopes of capturing them. Once the vines make contact, they wrap around the victim, and hold them in place while causing damage. The vines can only be escaped from by the target if the target dedicates an action with decent roleplay attempting to escape. The vines may also be cut or burned in order to allow the target to escape, but in the case of fire, the target sustains double the fire damage of the attack used to burn the vines. Summoning the group of vines requires an action, moving the vines requires an action, and damage is dealt to a captured target for each action the Viney spends trying to hold the target in place. Both the vines and the virus itself are damage zones. Any damage either one sustains counts against the virus' HP. Both are subject to terrain effects and those effects stack as if the virus were in two places at the same time (because it basically is).",

FlashBombs thrown by BigHats do not harm viruses at all when they explode. The effect of FlashBomb cannot be dodged, but it can be blocked by defenses you can take cover behind, such as objects and Guards. Chip generated barriers and auras also prevent the effect, but signature generated defenses of these types will not. As FlashBomb is a light based attack, it has slashing to pierce Shadow, and Seeking to pierce Invis (note that dodging alone does nothing, so Invis will not help here anyway).",

Dominerds are invisible unless attacking or blocking unless the only viruses present are all Dominerds. While non-dominerd viruses are present, Dominerds will block attacks against other viruses with their own bodies, and will take turns blocking these attacks. Dominerds have StoneBody, but must drop their defenses to attack an enemy. Dominerds will only start attacking when they are alone, or the only other viruses on the field are also Dominerds. All Dominerds carry and use stage changing chips. Dominerds do not intentionally use their Teleport abilities evasively, and tend to rely on Invisibility instead. Thus a strategy of attacking a Dominerd by forcing it to defend or countering when it attacks will negate any evasion bonus it may have gained from teleportation, as well as invis.
