Any non-breaking attack that strikes the Yo-Yo is nullified instantly, and the Yo-Yo is neither slowed nor stopped by them. Thus, head-to-head combat against Yorts is suicide unless the opponent is able to produce a Break attack of 40 or more damage to destroy the Yo-yo. Yorts cannot regenerate a destroyed Yo-Yo, and are completely helpless without it. If a Yort is deprived of its weapon, it will Escape after 2 turns. Yorts cannot damage other Yorts. If two Yo-yos collide in mid-air, they mutually annihilate each other. Yorts can't move while attacking. Yort attacks are faster than the battlechip version of Yo-Yo and have greater range, but have a tiny delay before the attack in exchange. Yo-Yos are immune to every effect (including Glitch) except Break. AoE effects can reach past a Yo-Yo, but do nothing to stop it. Yo-Yos self destruct if the Yort that fired them is deleted.",

If the enemy does run into the beam, they fire their Sensor Beam attack at the speed of light, which is practically guaranteed to hit. Firing a Sensor Beam requires an action only in that the KillerEye will pause to recharge after the attack, but there is no delay between tripping the laser beam and firing a sensor beam. If a Sensor Beam is fired after a KillerEye has already expended all actions for the turn, they skip the first action of the following turn to recharge. They cannot emit a new laser trip beam while recharging, and they cannot fire sensor beams consecutively as something must trigger the attack by breaking the line of a laser trip beam first. KillerEye viruses cannot maintain their laser trip beams while moving their eyes to look in a new direction, they also cannot perform a beam sweep with a sensor beam. Emitting or turning of a laser trip beam does not require an action, but taking aim at a new direction does. Laser trip beams cannot see past stationary objects, nor will stationary objects trigger a Sensor Beam attack.",

Once the vines make contact, they wrap around the victim, and hold them in place while causing damage. The vines can only be escaped from by the target if the target dedicates an action with decent roleplay attempting to escape. The vines may also be cut or burned in order to allow the target to escape, but in the case of fire, the target sustains double the fire damage of the attack used to burn the vines. Summoning the group of vines requires an action, moving the vines requires an action, and damage is dealt to a captured target for each action the Viney spends trying to hold the target in place. Both the vines and the virus itself are damage zones. Any damage either one sustains counts against the virus' HP.

		"family_note": "Puffball viruses are top tier, and shouldn't be encountered by players before battle 6. Puffball viruses move at an average rate, but they do not dodge. Instead they block non-break frontal attacks with their iron face masks until they manage to get within melee range. Once in range, they will launch their masks at the nearest enemy, and their masks will begin spewing a cloud of miasma in all directions. The viruses will become immobile once the mask is deployed, but they can turn to face a new direction in order to block incoming attacks and attack nearby enemies with the spiked sides of the mask. Turning requires an action, as it is an attack at this point. If the mask is destroyed (something that can only be done while the mask is deployed), the virus will spend the rest of its actions for the turn trying to evade the enemy. At the beginning of the next turn, the virus is able to generate a new mask, and will resume acting normally. The virus may recall its mask from the deployed position as a free action. Puffballs can use AreaGrab as a free action once per turn if they are wearing their mask. Due to how the poison effect this virus generates is handled, these viruses are lethal in groups.",

Fortunately, their rarity ensures they they never appear before a Battle 6, and there are never more than 2 in a single battle. While their horizontal movement is terrible at best, they can easily adjust their altitude as needed. By default, however, they tend to hover a couple of feet above the ground. The exception to this is when they attack. EarthJelly attack by launching large waves of mud at enemies The attack cycle of EarthJelly is 2 actions long. It requires one action to charge before firing. If they are stunned or otherwise temporarily disabled, they resume their attack cycle where it was halted once the stun wears off. When they attack, they drop to the ground in order to pump out as much liquid as possible. This allows them to harness the power of certain kinds of terrain to boost their attacks, but it also makes them immobile and vulnerable to ground-based attacks for the duration.",
