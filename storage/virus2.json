Gigas lack legs, and instead roll around on a 3 ton solid steel ball 2-feet in diameter that rests in a cupola. Rising from the top of the cupola is an alloy pillar that supports their metal bodies. The Gigas fight with their huge iron fists, which are provided their immese striking power by large barrel-like forearms. Their great-helm-like heads sit directly atop their shoulders with their blocky hinged jaw slanted in a sneer while their neon-red eyes radiate their hatred of all things Navigator. It is speculated that Gigas are a hacked derivative of the Bladia viruses spliced together with fragments of other viruses and a healthy dose of battlechip program data. This would account for their size, strength, and malicious nature. Where and how this was possibly accomplished is unknown. Gigas move at increased speed, but dodge at a slower than average rate. Gigas viruses prefer to pummel the life out of their foes with their bare hands (even though using the ball-and-chain in melee range would be more devastating), but if they find themselves surrounded or at a great distance to their target, they will use the ball-and-chain to perform a HammerToss. If an object blocks their path, they will either send it flying with a GigasArm attack, or smash it to dust before continuing on. Gigas will sink like the lead weights they are in liquid, and they know it. They will avoid liquid terrain entirely, if possible, and will never appear near these types of naturally occuring terrain for this reason. Only a Gigas' body is damageable. Striking a Gigas' cast iron arms will not damage the virus or the arms themselves, no matter what you hit them with. The Gigas' will not intentionally defend themselves with their arms, as they should be too busy pummeling or hurling something to bother. Do not abuse this.",

		"family_note": "The Ashuraid are a new strain of 6 foot tall semi-humanoid viruses with bodies made of durable metal alloys. Ashuraid viruses lack legs, and instead roll around on a 1 ton solid steel ball 1-foot in diameter that rests in a cupola. Rising from the top of the cupola is an alloy pillar that supports their smooth and curving metal bodies. The key defining feature of Ashuraid viruses are their half dozen free-floating arm segments constructed of an indestructible alloy. Three of these arms feature metallic rights hands, and the other three feature metallic left hands, thus they are differentiated. In combat, the virus will ball these hands up into fists, and launch volleys of rocket punches at their foes. The virus' helmeted head rests upon a short metallic rod-like neck with their faces hidden behind a metallic faceplate. The exception being their mouths, which are generally curved downwards in a permanent frown while in the presence of Navigators. It is speculated that Ashuraid are a hacked derivative of the Bladia viruses spliced together with fragments of other viruses and a healthy dose of battlechip program data. This would account for their size, strength, and malicious nature. Where and how this was possibly accomplished is unknown. Ashuraid viruses move and dodge at better than average speeds, although they rarely choose to dodge at all. Ashuraid viruses are ranged attackers, and prefer to hold the range open against their enemies as melee range attacks with their Impacting abilities generally render Counters useless. Ashuraids attack by launching their six free-floating indestructible alloy arms at one or more enemies in volleys of 3 rocket punches. It takes 3 arms to execute a MeteorKnucke attack, 3 to execute a Counter attack, and all 6 to execute their GiantHook attack. It takes roughly an action of cooldowm time after executing a long distance attack for the arms used in the attack to return to the Ashuraid's side. During this time, they may not execute a Counter Attack if they do not have enough arms available. Ergo if all 6 arms are either being used in an attack, or in cool-down following an attack or counter attack, the Ashuraid cannot use a Counter. The rest of their attacks do not require their arms to return to their side. The return feature is automatic, and does not require actions to perform. Ashuraid can move while attacking or defending, and are allowed to counter while dodging if enough arms are available. Setting a counter requires an action while executing one does not. Ashuraid are extremely heavy viruses that will sink like the lead weights they are in liquid, and they know it. They will avoid liquid terrain entirely, if possible, and will never appear near these types of naturally occurring terrain for this reason. Only an Ashuraid's body is damageable. Striking an Ashuraid's floating arms will not damage the virus or the arms themselves, no matter what you hit them with. The Ashuraids will not intentionally defend themselves with their arms outside of their Counter ability, which is nullified by Impact. Do not abuse this.",

Their faces are usually unseen, as they're covered in a red mask with string decorations. Their tails are twice as long as their actual bodies, and are usually curved into a question mark shape. At first this may seem like a simple design choice, but the tail is actually prehensile, and Bandcoon cleverly use it to steal chip data from Navis. Bandcoons' speed and small size combine to make them surprisingly difficult to hit while moving, and are even agile enough to turn sharply with little problem. However, if caught standing still, they're practically sitting ducks. However, when they're not using chips, they always prefer to move when possible. Their main tactic is to roll around and confound the enemy with their speed, then move in and swipe them with their tail, using it like a hook to grab data not directly tied to them, namely Battlechips. They can then use it themselves, at reduced power, as a free action. All other effects of the chips still apply, including pre-requisites to use the chip (i.e. Spice still needs Grass terrain, MachineSword still requires that the enemy be stunned). Higher level Bandcoon are aware of such conditions, and will try to satisfy the requirements if at all possible. If the enemy has no Battlechips, Bandcoons get extremely aggravated, and will ram an enemy in anger and desperation. However, they severely dislike doing this, and will only use this attack as a last resort for when they have no chips.",

The teleport counts as a dodge if utilized correctly. They then teleport back to their original spot, and do not move otherwise. They may use their secondary full-heal at any time, though they are more likely to do so when they are injured.

It retains the tail from its weaker form, though the flames are a bit more intense. The egg grows slightly. Its scales also become stronger which allows it to pop back in for a defensive action. The Raptegg's hind legs grow more so it can stand on them. Its head, similar to that of a raptor but gray, pops out of the egg too and a long gray scaly tail that moves behind him frantically, which is covered in roaring fire. The egg grows slightly again.

		"family_note": "A Mettank is a combination of the Metool, Catack, and Armadillo viruses. It looks a lot like a regular Catack, with several notable differences. The main body of the tank is slightly smaller, and the tank's driver is very clearly an actual Metool, though it doesn't bear its signature weapon. The vehicle itself is colored to match the Metool-driver's Helmet; thus the most basic version is gold with green trim, while more powerful versions will be colored differently to follow suit. The tank itself retains the same basic design as a Catack, except that its triangular treads have been replaced with four almost comically over-sized monster-truck style armored wheels, and its main gun now sports two long, narrow tines jutting out vertically up and down from a point close to the muzzle. These make it look rather like a giant version of a Metool's pickaxe, and the cannon is also now housed in a vertical pivot that allows it to adjust up and down, or even swing with enough force to strike the lower tine to the ground.<br><br>Most of the time, the Mettank moves very slowly, and it has been seen to activate a defensive mode wherein the Metool-driver's helmet expands to a jumbo size large enough to cover the entire tank in its protective dome. This does, of course, render the virus utterly blind, and when specifically guarding like this it can no longer attack or move.<br><br>It has also been seen, occasionally, to display sudden feats of unexpected speed, where it will rev up, then suddenly ram a target. At these times, its helmet defense covers the tank, though it recedes again as soon as the attack run loses momentum.",

		"family_note": "Navis without access to a useful amount of Slashing damage may struggle with the higher tier versions of this virus. Good RP is a perfectly good substitute in most cases, however the increasing shadow capabilities of the virus can prove problematic without. Check your target's arsenal before deploying this virus and consider carefully about doing so if their access to slashing is limited. Despite this, it should also be noted that this is not a particularly strong virus on its own, either in relative HP, or in offensive capabilities; it doesn't like the spotlight and will not fare well if deployed as the 'centre stage' focus of a battle.<br><br>For the most part, GrabBandit's prefer to remain hidden and the full extent of their actual form is hard to tell. Scattered reports have claimed that, when completely out of their shadow portals, the GrabBandit actually resembles a bandcoon, only larger, longer of body, sleek and lither, and seemingly made of solid shadow, with dazzling blue glows where its eyes should be. These stories also report that it sports a writhing forest of very long black tendrils that sprout from its back and wave about with a sentience of their own.<br><br>It appears quite nimble when on land, however the virus often moves within a ground-based portal, hidden from sight. When the portal is closed, with the GrabBandit inside, a shadow remains visible on the ground, a circle of roughly one panel, that heralds where the virus is. The portal shadow appears to move with great speed and precision, but only when it is not directly beneath a target. It flashes across the ground to rest directly under a new target, and the GrabBandit will generally attempt to attack that target right away, if it can. When fully out of the portal it is revealed to be, or at least to act as, the virus' own shadow.<br><br>In combat, they attempt to ensnare victims by means of opening the portal beneath their target and binding them quickly with a mass of black, shadowy vines. The portals can open to quite a wide size, depending on their target. Nothing but the GrabBandit can pass into or out of the portals, even while they are 'open'; even if one should be opened wide enough to leave a victim standing effectively on black empty space, it will seem like perfectly solid ground underfoot. Seeking attacks seem to disrupt the portal space, and eject the meta-virus back to normal netspace. Looking into a portal reveals only inky blackness, though very occasionally a flash of blue eye-glows might be glimpsed... Looking directly into an open portal is probably a bad idea anyway.<br><br>If the virus manages to bind a victim, a large pair Bandcoon paws, seemingly unattached to anything, rise out of the portal as well, and, accompanied by any spare tendrils or vines, perform a pat-down and search of its immobilised target, seeking recent chip data to steal and use. If, however, the GrabBandit is unable to use its vines, it will instead emerge from its portal in an effort to fully scope out the battlefield, moving defensively and attempting to ensure all targets are in its field of vision at once. As a defence mechanism, the GrabBandit appears to be able to flare the glows of its eyes brightly enough to bath the surrounding area in an over-powering blue light. It does this in a brief flash, fierce enough to leave victims dazzled and blinded, and even causing physical pain to those close by, before retreating into its portal again.<br><br>Between its defensive nature, and the efficiency of its movements while hidden, this virus has never been known to dodge or evade attackers, except by coincidence. Even when fully exposed it is usually far more interested in getting out of the spotlight quickly, or retreating into its portal again. Despite its shadowy appearance, the virus itself is solid enough that it does not count as being actually shadowed, though stronger variants of the virus have thrown this into question.",

Bind works on a per-action basis, instead of per-turn, and is maintained by physical contact with the source. Bind is cancelled by attacking the source with Slashing damage, or spending one or more actions to escape with good RP quality. Bound players may attack the vines with non-slashing attacks for normal damage, but this will not free them unless they destroy the virus. Unlike a regular withdrawal, which requires an action from the virus, if the vines are severed, the virus withdraws immediately.<br>Special: Slashing damage against the vines at any point will sever them from the portal temporarily, and prevent the GrabBandit (if it survives) from using them at all until the next turn, while they regenerate. Severed vines immediately disintegrate, and do not count as an attackable target after they have been cut.<br>Special: Spends much time hidden in its portal, although there is almost always an attackable portion outside. Exceptional or clever RP may find ways to draw a GrabBandit completely from its portal against its will, leaving it exposed.
